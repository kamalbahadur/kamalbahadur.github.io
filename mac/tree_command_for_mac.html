If you have used Ubuntu's tree command, you know how cool that is. To install tree command for Mac, follow these instructions:

Install brew by running the following command in your terminal:

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

You'll need to install Xcode as well if you don't have it already.

Now just run "brew install tree" to install tree command on mac.

I have tested this procedure on Mac Sierra.
